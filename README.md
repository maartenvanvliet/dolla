## App Store Receipt IAP Verification in Elixir

Dolla provides a wrapper over Apple's app store receipt verification service in
Elixir.

It aims to be relatively thin, giving you structs to play with instead of having
to deal withe logic and errors yourself.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add dolla to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:dolla, "~> 0.3.0"}]
        end

  2. Ensure dolla is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:dolla]]
        end
        
  3. If you're verifying receipts with recurring subscriptions, configure the
     secret in your dev.exs and prod.exs respectively
     
        config :dolla, :secret, "YOUR_SECRET"

## Usage

Once you have your base64 encoded receipt data (see [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH104-SW1) for more information), just pass them to `Dolla`.

```elixir
iex> Dolla.verify("A MASSIVE BUNCH OF BASE64")
{:ok, %Dolla.Response{status: 0, receipt: %Dolla.Receipt{...}}...}
```

Dolla returns a tuple, so you're probably going to want to match on that. If you
get `:ok` as the first element in the tuple, then your receipt has successfully
validated.
